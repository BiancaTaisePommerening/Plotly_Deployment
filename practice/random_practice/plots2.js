// Open VS Code and use Plotly to create a line chart of your own.

// Play around with the div ID, the JavaScript file name, and the data array.
// Then verify the results by opening index.html with your browser. You should see a chart.
// If the chart doesn't render, try opening the developer/debugging console.

// Make sure that you are comfortable with creating a line chart with Plotly before moving on.

Plotly.newPlot("test", [{x:[1,2,3,4,5],y:[2,4,6,8,10]}]);
